<p>Recursive Intent Propagation using Pretrained Embedding Distances
</h3>

RIPPED is a framework for bootstrapping natural language understanding in data-poor domains. It uses 
distance computations between pretrained sentence embeddings as a means to propagate the few labels we 
have through unlabeled space. This provides much higher accuracy in challenging classification domains, 
in particular those that are many-class, full of domain-specific language, or containing less than 10 
labeled examples per class. 

This repository contains the code used in writing my [honors thesis](https://mhsb.me/thesis).
